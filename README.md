 **2.3 PROPOSED SYSTEM**
In our system, users who want to sell or buy property must first register on the real estate platform. They can create a strong profile on the platform with their details such as proof of identity and government-issued designations. Owners can upload their property documents to the platform. Before uploading their documents to the platform, all documents are encrypted using the AES encryption algorithm. This is an encryption algorithm program that will encrypt and decrypt information. It's more secure than RSA, where it has no way been addressed and decrypted easily. Once the property details are uploaded to the platform by the owner, they will be made available to all users. If a buyer is interested in a particular property to buy. they can submit a request for accessing land specifications to the seller. The owner receives notice of access to the property. He can refuse or accept by referring to the buyer's profile. If he accepts, he sends the AES decryption key to access his ownership details. If the buyer is ready to purchase the land, he will send a request to send money to the seller. The seller will approve the land transfer request and the land inspector will be notified. Once the land inspector verifies the profile of buyers and sellers, digital transactions can be made to purchase the property. After the successful action of digital transaction, the land purchased contract is recovered using a hash generated by SHA256 and stored in the database to avoid future conflicts.

The hash code will be given to the buyer and the hash value would be stored in the database and if the hash code available with the buyer and database are the same; then the land bought agreement are authenticated and no modifications have been made. By the third-party members. Generally, SHA256 is the most prominently used hash algorithm in blockchains; Initializing five arbitrary hex-character strings that will be part of the SHA256 hash function is the first step. After that, 1 is added to the end of the string, followed by enough 0s, until the communication has 448 bits. The length of the communication addressed by 64 pieces is also added as far as possible, creating a string that has 512 pieces in length The above-entered padded input, M, is also broken up into sixteen 32-bit words. In the case of" Name," there has only one chunk because the string has smaller than 512 bits in total. Presently, we store the hash values in the factors and store the consequence of the piece's hash in the overall Hash value, everything is equal, and continue to execute the following chunks. After all the chunks have been reused, the message digest will convert into a bit string using the OR logical operator, and the hashed value is the final step.

** 6. CONCLUSION**
Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for securing sensitive land records, given its inherent characteristics of transparency, immutability, and decentralization. In light of the sensitivity of land records, it is imperative to establish and maintain them in a secure manner to ensure long-term availability and transparency. Manual land records, although traditional, are susceptible to risks if not handled with adequate treatment and care. This susceptibility highlights the need for a more robust and secure approach, especially in the digital age where data breaches and unauthorized access pose significant threats. By leveraging blockchain technology, an electronic database utilizing a consensus protocol, governments and organizations can address these challenges effectively. Blockchain's decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the entire system, thereby reducing the risk of tampering or manipulation of land records.

One of the key advantages of blockchain technology in securing land records is its ability to provide transparency and auditability. Traditional land record systems often lack transparency, making it difficult for stakeholders to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the data. With blockchain, every transaction or update to the land records is recorded in a tamper-proof and immutable manner, creating a transparent audit trail. This transparency not only enhances trust among stakeholders but also reduces the potential for fraud and corruption. By providing a verifiable record of ownership and transactions, blockchain technology can significantly improve the integrity of land record management systems.

Moreover, blockchain technology offers enhanced security measures to protect land records from unauthorized access and tampering. The use of cryptographic techniques, such as the SHA-256 hash algorithm, ensures that data stored on the blockchain is securely encrypted and virtually impossible to alter without detection. Each block in the blockchain contains a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain of interconnected blocks that are resistant to tampering. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks means that even if one node is compromised, the integrity of the entire system remains intact. This robust security infrastructure makes blockchain an ideal solution for safeguarding sensitive land records against cyber threats and data breaches.

In addition to security and transparency, blockchain technology offers unparalleled resilience and availability, ensuring the long-term accessibility of land records. Traditional land record systems often face challenges such as data loss, system failures, and natural disasters, which can lead to the loss or destruction of critical information. By distributing copies of the blockchain ledger across multiple nodes in a network, blockchain technology mitigates the risk of data loss and ensures continuous availability. Even in the event of a node failure or network outage, the decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that other nodes can still access and verify the integrity of the data. This resilience makes blockchain an ideal solution for storing and managing land records, particularly in regions prone to political instability or environmental hazards.

Furthermore, the adoption of blockchain technology for land record management can streamline administrative processes and reduce operational costs. Traditional land record systems often involve manual paperwork, cumbersome administrative procedures, and intermediaries, leading to inefficiencies and delays. By digitizing land records on a blockchain platform, governments and organizations can automate routine tasks such as property transfers, title registrations, and land surveys. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements encoded on the blockchain, can facilitate the automatic transfer of ownership rights based on predefined conditions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of human error. This automation not only accelerates the pace of transactions but also reduces administrative overheads, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of land record management.

In conclusion, blockchain technology holds immense potential for securing land records in a robust and transparent manner. By leveraging cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus protocols, blockchain ensures the integrity, security, and availability of land records, thereby reducing the risk of fraud, corruption, and data breaches. Moreover, blockchain technology offers opportunities for streamlining administrative processes, improving operational efficiency, and reducing costs. As governments and organizations continue to explore innovative solutions for land record management, blockchain stands out as a promising technology that can revolutionize the way land records are stored, accessed, and managed in the digital age.
